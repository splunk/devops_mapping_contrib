# Contributing

Contributions are encouraged and greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs/Issues:

If you are reporting a bug or issues, please include:

-   Operating system name and version.
-   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful
    in troubleshooting
-   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Check the Issues for this repo on GitHub. Anything tagged with
a "bug" ticket type is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier
    to implement.
-   Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that
    contributions are welcome :)

Mappings for new DevOps technologies and enhancements to current mappings are all greatly appreciated!

Please file an issue or check the issues for this repo on GitHub for an existing issue for the technology in question. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and/or "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it. If you'd like to contribute mappings you already have please also create an issue which can be tied to your pull request.

Once issues are posted and triaged please include their issue number in any PRs related to that work.

### Write Documentation

Submissions and `README.md` files could always use more documentation. Documentation can always use an update or tweak in the official docs, in docstrings of scripts, comments in configs, or anywhere a bit of clarity may be useful..

### Submit Issues / Feedback

If you are submitting an issue regarding support or feedback on current mappings:

-   Explain in detail how to recreate any bugs or unexpected behavior
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier
    to triage the issue.
-   Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that
    contributions are welcome :)
